        <rdfs:label>Lake Toba</rdfs:label>
        <destinesia:abstract>Lake Toba (Indonesian: Danau Toba) (Toba Batak: ᯖᯀᯬ ᯖᯬᯅ; romanized: Tao
            Toba) is a large natural lake in North Sumatra, Indonesia, occupying the caldera of a
            supervolcano. The lake is located in the middle of the northern part of the island of
            Sumatra, with a surface elevation of about 900 metres (2,953 ft), the lake stretches
            from 2°53′N 98°31′E / 2.88°N 98.52°E to 2°21′N 99°06′E / 2.35°N 99.1°E. The lake is
            about 100 kilometres (62 miles) long, 30 kilometres (19 mi) wide, and up to 505 metres
            (1,657 ft) deep. It is the largest lake in Indonesia and the largest volcanic lake in
            the world. Toba Caldera is one of twenty Geoparks in Indonesia, and was recognised in
            July 2020 as one of the UNESCO Global Geoparks. Lake Toba is the site of a supervolcanic
            eruption estimated at VEI 8 that occurred 69,000 to 77,000 years ago, representing a
            climate-changing event. Recent advances in dating methods suggest a more accurate
            identification of 74,000 years ago as the date. It is the largest-known explosive
            eruption on Earth in the last 25 million years. According to the Toba catastrophe
            theory, it had global consequences for human populations; it killed most humans living
            at that time and is believed to have created a population bottleneck in central east
            Africa and India, which affects the genetic make-up of the human worldwide population to
            the present. More recent studies have cast doubt on this theory and found no evidence of
            substantial changes in global population. It has been accepted that the eruption of the
            Toba Caldera led to a volcanic winter with a worldwide decrease in temperature between 3
            to 5 °C (5.4 to 9.0 °F), and up to 15 °C (27 °F) in higher latitudes. Additional studies
            in Lake Malawi in East Africa show significant amounts of ash being deposited from the
            Toba Caldera eruptions, even at that great distance, but little indication of a
            significant climatic effect in East Africa.</destinesia:abstract>

        <destinesia:abstract>Lorentz National Park is a national park located in Central Papua,
            Indonesia, in the southwest of western New Guinea. With an area of 25,056 km2 (9,674
            mi2), it is the largest national park in Southeast Asia. In 1999 Lorentz was declared a
            World Heritage Site by UNESCO. An outstanding example of the biodiversity of New Guinea,
            Lorentz is one of the most ecologically diverse national parks in the world. It is the
            only nature reserve in the Asia-Pacific region to contain a full altitudinal array of
            ecosystems ranging through marine areas, mangroves, tidal and freshwater swamp forest,
            lowland and montane rainforest, alpine tundra, and equatorial glaciers. At 4884 meters,
            Puncak Jaya (formerly Carstensz Pyramid) is the tallest mountain between the Himalayas
            and the Andes. Birdlife International has called Lorentz Park “probably the single most
            important reserve in New Guinea”. It contains five of World Wildlife Fund's "Global 200"
            ecoregions: Southern New Guinea Lowland Forests; New Guinea Montane Forests; New Guinea
            Central Range Subalpine Grasslands; New Guinea Mangroves; and New Guinea Rivers and
            Streams. Lorentz Park contains many unmapped and unexplored areas, and is certain to
            contain many species of plants and animals as yet unknown to Western science. Local
            communities' ethnobotanical and ethnozoological knowledge of the Lorentz biota is also
            very poorly documented. The park is named for Hendrikus Albertus Lorentz, a Dutch
            explorer who passed through the area on his 1909–10 expedition. </destinesia:abstract>

            species. The park is representative of Indonesian tropical water ecosystems, consisting
            of seagrass plain, coral reef, and coastal ecosystems. It was established as a national
            park in 1991 and is among the first of Indonesia's growing system of marine parks. It
            covers a total area of 890.65 km², 97% of which is marine habitat. The remaining 3% of
            the park is terrestrial, including the five islands of Bunaken, Manado Tua, Mantehage,

        <destinesia:abstract>Kuta is a tourist area, administratively an urban village (kelurahan),
            and the capital of Kuta District, Badung Regency, southern Bali, Indonesia. A former
            fishing village, it was one of the first towns on Bali to see substantial tourist
            development, and as a beach resort remains one of Indonesia's major tourist
            destinations. It is known internationally for its long sandy beach, varied
            accommodation, many restaurants and bars, and many renowned surfers who visit from
            Australia. It is located near Bali's Ngurah Rai Airport. The Balinese Provincial
            Government have taken the view that the preservation of the Balinese culture, natural
            resources and wildlife are of primary importance in the development of the island. To
            this end they have limited tourist development to the peninsula on the extreme southern
            aspect of the island; Kuta beach is on the western side of this peninsula and Sanur is
            on the east. To the north of the peninsula no new tourist development is supposedly
            permitted. To the south, Kuta Beach extends beyond the airport into Jimbaran. Other
            nearby towns and villages include Seseh (6.4 nm), Denpasar (4.5 nm), Ujung (1.8 nm),
            Pesanggaran (2.0 nm), Kedonganan (2.9 nm), and Tuban (1.0 nm).</destinesia:abstract>

        <destinesia:abstract>Borobudur, also transcribed Barabudur (Indonesian: Candi Borobudur,
            Javanese: ꦕꦤ꧀ꦝꦶꦧꦫꦧꦸꦝꦸꦂ, romanized: Candhi Barabudhur) is a 9th-century Mahayana Buddhist
            temple in Magelang Regency, not far from the town of Muntilan, in Central Java,
            Indonesia. It is the world's largest Buddhist temple. The temple consists of nine
            stacked platforms, six square and three circular, topped by a central dome. It is
            decorated with 2,672 relief panels and originally 504 Buddha statues. The central dome
            is surrounded by 72 Buddha statues, each seated inside a perforated stupa. Built in the
            9th century during the reign of the Sailendra Dynasty, the temple design follows
            Javanese Buddhist architecture, which blends the Indonesian indigenous tradition of
            ancestor worship and the Buddhist concept of attaining nirvāṇa. The temple demonstrates
            the influences of Gupta art that reflects India's influence on the region, yet there are
            enough indigenous scenes and elements incorporated to make Borobudur uniquely
            Indonesian. The monument is a shrine to the Buddha and a place for Buddhist pilgrimage.
            The pilgrim journey begins at the base of the monument and follows a path around the
            monument, ascending to the top through three levels symbolic of Buddhist cosmology:
            Kāmadhātu (the world of desire), Rūpadhātu (the world of forms) and Arūpadhātu (the
            world of formlessness). The monument guides pilgrims through an extensive system of
            stairways and corridors with 1,460 narrative relief panels on the walls and the
            balustrades. Borobudur has one of the largest and most complete ensembles of Buddhist
            reliefs in the world. Evidence suggests that Borobudur was constructed in the 9th
            century and subsequently abandoned following the 14th-century decline of Hindu kingdoms
            in Java and the Javanese conversion to Islam. Worldwide knowledge of its existence was
            sparked in 1814 by Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, then the British ruler of Java, who was
            advised of its location by native Indonesians. Borobudur has since been preserved
            through several restorations. The largest restoration project was undertaken between
            1975 and 1982 by the Indonesian government and UNESCO, followed by the monument's
            listing as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Borobudur is the largest Buddhist temple in the
            world, and ranks with Bagan in Myanmar and Angkor Wat in Cambodia as one of the great
            archeological sites of Southeast Asia. Borobudur remains popular for pilgrimage, with
            Buddhists in Indonesia celebrating Vesak Day at the monument. Borobudur is Indonesia's
            single most visited tourist attraction.</destinesia:abstract>

            romanized: Rara Jonggrang) is a 9th-century Hindu temple compound in Special Region of
            Yogyakarta, Indonesia, dedicated to the Trimūrti, the expression of God as the Creator
            (Brahma), the Preserver (Vishnu) and the Destroyer (Shiva). The temple compound is
            located approximately 17 kilometres (11 mi) northeast of the city of Yogyakarta on the
            boundary between Central Java and Yogyakarta provinces. The temple compound, a UNESCO
            World Heritage Site, is the largest Hindu temple site in Indonesia and the
            second-largest in Southeast Asia after Angkor Wat. It is characterized by its tall and
            pointed architecture, typical of Hindu architecture, and by the towering 47-metre-high
            (154 ft) central building inside a large complex of individual temples. Prambanan temple
            compounds originally consists of 240 temple structures; which represents the grandeur of
            ancient Java's Hindu art and architecture, also considered as a masterpiece of the

        <rdfs:label>Ampera Bridge</rdfs:label>
        <destinesia:abstract>Ampera Bridge (Indonesian: Jembatan Ampera, for Amanat Penderitaan
            Rakyat [Mandate of People's Suffering], a now-rarely used colloquial name for the
            preamble of the Constitution of Indonesia), formerly Bung Karno Bridge (Indonesian:
            Jembatan Bung Karno, after President Sukarno) between its opening and the 1966
            De-Sukarnoization campaign, is a vertical-lift bridge in the city of Palembang, South
            Sumatra, Indonesia. It connects Seberang Ulu and Seberang Ilir, two regions of
            Palembang. It can no longer be opened to allow ships to pass. The bridge was planned
            during the era of Indonesia's first president, Sukarno, who wanted a bridge that could
            open and be a match for London's Tower Bridge. The funds for the construction came from
            Japanese war reparations, with Fuji Heavy Industries being given responsibility for
            design and construction. However, at the time, Japan had no bridges of this type, and
            Fuji Heavy Industries had no bridge-building experience. The official opening was
            carried out by Governor of South Sumatra, Abujazid Bustomi, on 10 November 1965. At
            first, the bridge was known as the Bung Karno Bridge, after the president, but following
            his fall, it was renamed the Ampera Bridge. For a few years after it was opened, the
            centre span could be lifted at a speed of approximately 10 metres per minute to allow
            ships of up to 44.5m in height to pass underneath. However, this only occurred a few
            times, and after 1970 it could no longer be opened. The official reason for this was
            that the 30 minutes needed to raise the bridge was causing unacceptable delays, and that
            in any case silting of the river had made it impassable for large ships. However,
            according to architect Wiratman, who acted as a consultant before the construction, the
            design of the bridge was flawed from the outset because of the soft mud on which it was
            built. He maintains that his concerns were ignored for political reasons, and that as
            the towers' foundations shifted, the bridge deformed to the extent that it could no
            longer be opened. The ballast weights needed to balance the weight of the bridge were
            removed in 1990 to prevent possible accidents were they to fall. The bridge's colour has
            been changed three times. At first it was grey, but it was changed to be yellow in 1992.
            And in 2002, when Indonesia was led by Megawati Sukarnoputri as president, the colour
            was changed again to red.</destinesia:abstract>

            by Suharto's descendants since his death. It has an area of about 100 hectares (250
            acres). The park is a synopsis of Indonesian culture, with virtually all aspects of
            daily life in Indonesia's 26 (in 1975) provinces encapsulated in separate pavilions with
            the collections of rumah adat as the example of Indonesian vernacular architecture,

            It was conceived by the Catholic Crosier missionary in 1969 as a way to preserve
            traditional Asmat art as well as provide economic outlets to the Asmat people. It was
            built by the Catholic Crosier Diocese of Agats-Asmat, which also owns the museum, and
            supported by Crosier Fathers and Brothers Bishop Alphonse Sowada, originally from
            Elmdale, Minnesota, US. The American artist Tobias Schneebaum and Ursula and Gunter
            Konrad helped in establishing the museum and it officially opened on August 17, 1973.
            The museum has catalogued approximately 1,200 items to its collection. Over 600 are on
            display, including over 300 sculptural pieces, ancestor poles, shields, and drums.
            Later, upon retiring to his native St. Cloud, MN, US area, Bishop emeritus Sowada was
            also instrumental in founding a second Asmat museum, the American Museum of Asmat Art
            which opened in 1995 at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota, where it
            also appears under the acronyms AMAA and AMAA@UST. The director of the Asmat Museum of
            Culture and Progress, as of 2007, has been Eric Sarkol with John Ohoiwirin as assistant.
            Building upon a 1968–1974 United Nations funded Asmat wood carving project, the museum
            hosts an annual woodcarving competition and auction. The 31st Asmat Culture Festival

        <rdfs:label>Sea World Jakarta</rdfs:label>
        <destinesia:abstract>Sea World Jakarta or also known Sea World Ancol is a marine aquarium
            suited in North Jakarta, Jakarta, Indonesia. It consists of a main tank, an shark tank,
            and several other tanks, including a turtle exhibit. The Main tank of SeaWorld Ancol is
            one of the biggest aquarium in Southeast Asia. SeaWorld Ancol was briefly closed in
            September 2014 but reopened on July 17, 2015, to the public. SeaWorld Ancol is currently
            expanding to turn the aquarium into the world's largest sea park. The aquarium used to
            keep a couple of dugong named Doel and Diana since 2000, both died in 2016. In 2018,
            SeaWorld rescued a baby dugong that was caught by fishermen. After being treated
            intensively and being able to start eating seagrass, the baby dugong was able to be
            released back into its natural habitat. The dugong aquarium now houses sea turtles.
            Parni the giant stingray was the former icon of SeaWorld Ancol. Parni was caught by
            fishermen from Palabuhanratu, Sukabumi, West Java. The aquarium rescued Parni and placed
            in the main aquarium. Parni lived in SeaWorld for nine years until it died in 2008 due
            to old age. Parni's body was preserved and placed in the aquarium's museum. SeaWorld
            Ancol considered making a reptile exhibit called HerpetoZone and a Humboldt penguin
            exhibit, but were cancelled due to lack of funding and space. They also considered
            introducing the ocean sunfish and mahi-mahi to their main aquarium, but it was canned
            since these two species required large, open exhibits with no rocks nor reefs. A plan
            for a Raja Ampat Islands thematic exhibit that featured species such as the Indonesian
            speckled carpetshark was canned as well. The penguin exhibit plan was transferred to
            Ocean Dream Samudera in 2018, which they managed to build and open in 2019. Sea World
            has drawn controversy among Indonesian environmental activists when they plan to bring
            in a whale shark from the water of Berau Regency, East Kalimantan to the main aquarium.
            They worry that the whale shark will be stressed and eventually die when kept in the
            aquarium. The refusal was submitted via an online petition at Change.org. SeaWorld
            denied the whale shark plans, saying that the whale shark was not in the cooperation
            agreement with the Berau Regency government. In 2013, Sea World Jakarta acquired 10
            scalloped hammerhead sharks from the Farglory Ocean Park in Taiwan, becoming the first
            and only public aquarium to keep the hammerhead shark in Indonesia. After a period of
            adjustment, six hammerhead sharks is displayed in the aquarium's shark tank in December
            2013. As of 2022, no hammerhead sharks were on display.</destinesia:abstract>
